# Responsible-and-Reproducible-AI
Wildfires have become more frequent with climatic changes and cause devastating damages. To reduce the damages caused by these, emmergency management systems need to be improved. Wildfire detection is one way to improve early response times.

This project uses the Sen2Fire Benchmark dataset that looks at levl 2D data from the Sentinel 2 and 5P satellites.

A reproducible and explainable deep learning algorithm will be developed.
